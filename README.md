# Recipe web application
This app is using [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).
With the help of this application you can search for meals, and you can also save them to your favourites. After refreshing the page, your favourites stay there, but if you decide to delete them, you can do so. 
When you come to the app, a homepage is waiting for you. This homepage shows all the meals which start with the letter b. 
All the meals contain a link, which takes you to YouTube, where you can watch how to make that meal.
